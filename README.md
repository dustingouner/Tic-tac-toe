# Tic-tac-toe

### Abstract:
This application allows a user to play tic tac toe against another player. The user is able to select from 9 different celebrity characters in which to add as their player token. Once player 1 and player 2 have made their selections the user would click on the "play game" button in order to see the new game board. A message at the top displays the players turn. Once a player as won the score is then added to the players score under their character token. If a player decides to change celebrity characters then they can do so by clicking on the "choose another player" button.

### Learning Goals:
Solidify and demonstrate my understanding of:
DRY JavaScript
Event delegation to handle similar event listeners
Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
Use problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

### Wins + Challenges:

Wins: 

Having the game function as intended. Gaining a better understanding of how classes interact with one another. Becoming more familiar with flexbox and styling in CSS. Adding an additional feature of having multiple character selections for each player.

Challenges:

My biggest challenge was adding the feature of multiple character selections for each player. I did not decide to do this until towards the end of the project timeline. If I had to do it over again, I would plan better for adding additional features if time allowed. I was able to complete the feature with a few bugs that need to be addressed. Another challenge was finding images that played well with my css. This seems to always be a struggle unless you are willing to pay for premium images.
